<h1>Its looks good</h1>
  </h2>poem by Emily Maldonado Tovar
  
<p>  What does "looks good" mean? .</p>
  <br> What can I say instead of "it looks good"? What to say instead of "it is good"? How do you say "looks good" formally?
  <br> Well normally alot of people messages their response saying It looks good When needing help by someone for help or give you a solution we say it looks good.
  <br>Or doing homework and give it to the teacher , teacher says It looks great! But when saying hi to a friend and see what they wear we say you look good or you look good??

<p>  far. But then we say to ourselves is saying "It looks good," word " is a word we can tell to people?
  <br>  "like saying "it looks good feels like off as if we feel like we are ignoring what their talking about or not care 
  <br>   We dont know anymore if saying it looks good Can appreciate people
  <br>  "it looks good" is only talking about right now, but maybe we can  use to talk about something in general. "it's look good" is incorrect

<p> Maybe we can say other words like Is it correct to say "You look good", 'you look amazing' "you look beatiful"or we can say "you look extordinary"  instead of 'You are  cool‚Äù
</p>Instead of saying "it looks good" because it feels like you dont care of their own opinion or what they say about.
</p> so i wanna say It looks good" is perfectly good, because 'good' modifies 'it', not 'looks'. In "It looks well", 'well' modifies 'looks', 
  </p> but can feel like the invidual doesnt care so maybe its better if you say other positive words to make the invidual feel like you respect them instead of looking at you "like you dont care"
